### Speed Grapple 3D

My Submission for the 2025 GMTK Game Jam. Swing through a maze of blocks with a grappling hook, to reach the finish sphere, all while trying to get the best time possible!

The theme was LOOP, I aimed to capture the experience of speedrunning games, playing the same level over and over again all while striving to shave miliseconds off your time.â€‹
